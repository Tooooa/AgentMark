      "finalAnswer": "I have successfully retrieved the current trending feed of videos with a limit of 20 records using the 'Trending feed (Video posts) V2' tool, which provides direct URLs to videos, statistics, and additional metadata such as videos without watermarks. Additionally, I filtered the feed based on the hashtag #summer using the 'Hashtag feed (Video posts) V2' tool, also with a limit of 20 records, offering similar details including video URLs and stats. Due to response length limits, the full data arrays are not displayed here, but you can access them by running the tools directly. Both feeds include comprehensive information like view counts, likes, comments, and direct video links for analysis."
